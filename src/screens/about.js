                community in this deadly crisis of Covidâ€™19. Our mission is to save lives of people
                across the Pakistan by connecting them with a right donor. We are motivated to work hard 
                and reach out to potential donors so that they can support our mission of saving lives 
                by being a part of our campaign.
